<h2>Procedural-CSG</h2>
<hr>
<h4>A space for making art, functional pieces, and sharing useful snippets<h4>
<h3>Languages:</h3>
<p><ul>
 <li>openSCAD</li>
 <li>openJSCAD</li>
 <li>ShapeJS</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>
The idea is to think of products that could hugely benefit from being 100% parametrized. Using ShapeJS or openJSCAD should allow for the creation of a website with an intelligent UI that feeds a parametric design. Using the aforementioned CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) engines would let the user see a preview of their creation in 3D space before putting in an order.

<i>For example - hinges, drawer organizers, coffee pod holder, lighter cases, etc...</i>

<h3>Art:</h3>
<p>
I'm very interested in "Bloom" sculptures and procedurely generated art. I think openSCAD and similar CSG softwares have a huge potential to creating beautiful algorithmic art.
