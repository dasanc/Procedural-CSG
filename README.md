# openscad_projects

Disclaimer:
  This is my first repo and I really truly hope to make worthwhile OpenSCAD projects.

Purpose:
  The idea is to think of simple consumer products that could hugely benefit from being 100% parametrized.
  For example - hinges, drawer organizers, ...that's it so far.
  
  I'm also very interested in "Bloom" sculptures and procedurely generated art. I think this will be a good home for them as well.
